                    <p>Hi there! I’m Eyiladeogo, a dedicated Fullstack Developer from Nigeria. I have a strong focus on detail and a commitment to excellence, which drives me to build robust and scalable web applications. My tech journey began with a curiosity about how things work, which quickly evolved into a full-fledged career. I started with Python and Django Rest Framework, creating APIs and integrating them with mobile frontends using Flutter. Nowadays, I specialize in crafting intuitive user interfaces and powerful backend systems using Django, Node, and React as my main stack, ensuring a smooth experience for end-users. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing basketball, chess, or discovering new culinary experiences. Let’s connect and create something incredible together!</p>
