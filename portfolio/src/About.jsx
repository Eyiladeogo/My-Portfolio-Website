                <p>Hello! I'm Eyiladeogo, a passionate Fullstack Developer based in Nigeria. With a keen eye for detail and a drive for excellence, I thrive on creating robust and scalable web applications. My journey in the tech world started with a curiosity for how things work, which quickly evolved into a full-fledged career. I originally started my career with Python and the Django Rest Framework. I created some APIs and integrated them into frontends for mobile applications using Flutter. Now I specialize in developing intuitive user interfaces and powerful backend systems as a fullstack developer using Django, Node and React as my main stack, ensuring a seamless experience for end-users. When I'm not coding, you can find me playing basketball, chess, or exploring new culinary delights. Let's connect and build something amazing together!</p>
